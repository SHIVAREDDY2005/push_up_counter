# push_up_counter
This project is an interactive AI-powered fitness tracker built with OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Streamlit. It allows users to automatically count their push-ups (or dips) either through live webcam feed or by uploading a video. The app provides real-time pose detection, visual feedback, and a processed video with push-up counts overlaid.
